## Privacy Policy for SourceSnap

**Effective Date:** January 2026

SourceSnap (“the Extension”) is a browser extension designed to assist software developers in identifying the source code location associated with elements rendered in a web page during local development. This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension handles data and outlines the privacy practices applicable to its use.

### 1. Data Collection and Processing

SourceSnap does not collect, process, transmit, or store any personal data.

The Extension does not collect:

* Personally identifiable information
* Browsing history
* Authentication credentials
* Website content
* Usage analytics or telemetry
* Any other user data

All functionality is performed locally within the user’s browser environment.

### 2. Local Processing

The Extension operates entirely on the user’s device. When activated by a user-initiated action such as an Alt or Option click, SourceSnap inspects the current webpage’s JavaScript execution context to detect source location metadata provided by development frameworks or tooling.

This information is used solely to construct a local editor URL to open the corresponding source file. No data is transmitted outside the user’s browser at any time.

### 3. Permissions and Access

SourceSnap requests only the minimum permissions necessary to perform its single, narrowly defined purpose.

* **Active Tab Access:** Used only after explicit user interaction to analyze the currently active webpage.
* **Host Permissions:** Used to inject scripts into user-enabled pages for detecting framework-specific source metadata.
* **Storage Access:** Used exclusively to store local configuration settings such as preferred editor, keyboard modifier, and enabled domains.

These permissions are never used to collect, monitor, or transmit user data.

### 4. Data Storage

Any data stored by the Extension consists solely of non-personal configuration preferences and is retained locally using Chrome’s extension storage mechanisms. This data remains on the user’s device and is not shared with the developer or any third party.

### 5. Third-Party Services

SourceSnap does not integrate with, rely on, or communicate with any third-party services, analytics providers, advertising networks, or external APIs.

### 6. Remote Code

The Extension does not load or execute remote code. All executable code is packaged within the extension at the time of installation.

### 7. Children’s Privacy

SourceSnap is intended for use by developers and is not directed toward children under the age of 13. The Extension does not knowingly collect data from children.

### 8. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated if the Extension’s functionality changes in a way that affects data handling practices. Any updates will be published at the same location as this policy.

### 9. Contact Information

For questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer through the Chrome Web Store listing or the project’s public repository.
